Developing selective DRG stimulation to manage visceral pain requires knowledge of the topological distribution of colorectal afferent somata which are sparsely distributed in the DRG. Here, we implemented GCaMP6f to conduct high-throughput optical recordings of colorectal afferent activities in lumbosacral DRG, that is, optical electrophysiology. Using a mouse ex vivo preparation with distal colorectum and L5-S1 DRG in continuity, we recorded 791 colorectal afferents' responses to graded colorectal distension (15, 30, 40, and 60 mmHg) and/or luminal shear flow (20-30 mL/min), then functionally classified them into four mechanosensitive classes, and determined the topological distribution of their somata in the DRG. Of the 791 colorectal afferents, 90.8% were in the L6 DRG, 8.3% in the S1 DRG, and only 0.9% in the L5 DRG. L6 afferents had all four classes: 29% mucosal, 18.4% muscular-mucosal, 34% low-threshold (LT) muscular, and 18.2% high-threshold (HT) muscular afferents. S1 afferents only had three classes: 19.7% mucosal, 34.8% LT muscular, and 45.5% HT muscular afferents. All seven L5 afferents were HT muscular. In L6 DRG, somata of HT muscular afferents were clustered in the caudal region whereas somata of the other classes did not cluster in specific regions. Outcomes of this study can directly inform the design and improvement of next-generation neuromodulation devices that target the DRG to alleviate visceral pain in IBS patients."

Dong, ","""Investigation of Pain Mechanisms by Calcium Imaging Approaches."", ",Neuroscience bulletin ,34(1) ,(Feb. 2018). ,PUBMED: 28501905; ,DOI 10.1007/s12264-017-0139-9.,"Due to the complex circuitry and plethora of cell types involved in somatosensation, it is becoming increasingly important to be able to observe cellular activity at the population level. In addition, since cells rely on an intricate variety of extracellular factors, it is important to strive to maintain the physiological environment. Many electrophysiological techniques require the implementation of artificially-produced physiological environments and it can be difficult to assess the activity of many cells simultaneously. Moreover, imaging Ca2+ transients using Ca2+-sensitive dyes often requires in vitro preparations or in vivo injections, which can lead to variable expression levels. With the development of more sensitive genetically-encoded Ca2+ indicators (GECIs) it is now possible to observe changes in Ca2+ transients in large populations of cells at the same time. Recently, groups have used a GECI called GCaMP to address fundamental questions in somatosensation. Researchers can now induce GCaMP expression in the mouse genome using viral or gene knock-in approaches and observe the activity of populations of cells in the pain pathway such as dorsal root ganglia (DRG), spinal neurons, or glia. This approach can be used in vivo and thus maintains the organism's biological integrity. The implementation of GCaMP imaging has led to many advances in our understanding of somatosensation. Here, we review the current findings in pain research using GCaMP imaging as well as discussing potential methodological considerations."

Feng, ","""High-Throughput Functional Characterization of Visceral Afferents by Optical Recordings From Thoracolumbar and Lumbosacral Dorsal Root Ganglia."", ",Frontiers in neuroscience ,15 ,(2021). ,PUBMED: 33776645; ,DOI 10.3389/fnins.2021.657361.,"Functional understanding of visceral afferents is important for developing the new treatment to visceral hypersensitivity and pain. The sparse distribution of visceral afferents in dorsal root ganglia (DRGs) has challenged conventional electrophysiological recordings. Alternatively, Ca2+ indicators like GCaMP6f allow functional characterization by optical recordings. Here we report a turnkey microscopy system that enables simultaneous Ca2+ imaging at two parallel focal planes from intact DRG. By using consumer-grade optical components, the microscopy system is cost-effective and can be made broadly available without loss of capacity. It records low-intensity fluorescent signals at a wide field of view (1.9 × 1.3 mm) to cover a whole mouse DRG, with a high pixel resolution of 0.7 micron/pixel, a fast frame rate of 50 frames/sec, and the capability of remote focusing without perturbing the sample. The wide scanning range (100 mm) of the motorized sample stage allows convenient recordings of multiple DRGs in thoracic, lumbar, and sacral vertebrae. As a demonstration, we characterized mechanical neural encoding of visceral afferents innervating distal colon and rectum (colorectum) in GCaMP6f mice driven by VGLUT2 promotor. A post-processing routine is developed for conducting unsupervised detection of visceral afferent responses from GCaMP6f recordings, which also compensates the motion artifacts caused by mechanical stimulation of the colorectum. The reported system offers a cost-effective solution for high-throughput recordings of visceral afferent activities from a large volume of DRG tissues. We anticipate a wide application of this microscopy system to expedite our functional understanding of visceral innervations."
