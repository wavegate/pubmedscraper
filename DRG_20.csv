Here, we report that spinal nerve ligation (SNL) increased CXCR3 expression in dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons, and intra-DRG injection of Cxcr3 shRNA attenuated the SNL-induced mechanical allodynia and heat hyperalgesia. SNL also increased the mRNA levels of CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas only CXCL10 increased the number of action potentials (APs) in DRG neurons. Furthermore, in Cxcr3-/- mice, CXCL10 did not increase the number of APs, and the SNL-induced increase of the numbers of APs in DRG neurons was reduced. Finally, CXCL10 induced the activation of p38 and ERK in ND7-23 neuronal cells and DRG neurons. Pretreatment of DRG neurons with the P38 inhibitor SB203580 decreased the number of APs induced by CXCL10. Our data indicate that CXCR3, activated by CXCL10, mediates p38 and ERK activation in DRG neurons and enhances neuronal excitability, which contributes to the maintenance of neuropathic pain."

To explore these characteristics, the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglion (DRG) in the chronic constriction injury (CCI) sciatic nerve rat model was studied. Retrograde trace labeling combined with immunofluorescence technology was applied to analyze the distribution of neuropathic nociceptive P2X1-6 receptors. Our results suggest that Fluoro-Gold (FG) retrograde trace labeling is an efficient method for studying lumbosacral DRG neurons in the CCI rat model, especially when the DRG neurons are divided into small, medium, and large subgroups. We found that neuropathic nociceptive lumbosacral DRG neurons (i.e., FG-positive cells) were significantly increased in medium DRG neurons, while they declined in the large DRG neurons in the CCI group. P2X3 receptors were markedly upregulated in medium while P2X2 receptors were significantly decreased in small FG-positive DRG neurons. There were no significant changes in other P2X receptors (including P2X1, P2X4, P2X5, and P2X6). We anticipate that P2X receptors modulate nociceptive sensitivity primarily through P2X3 subtypes that are upregulated in medium neuropathic nociceptive DRG neurons and/or via the downregulation of P2X2 cells in neuropathic nociceptive small DRG neurons."

IL-6-induced dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptor excitability is attenuated in mice lacking eIF4E phosphorylation, in MNK1/2-/- mice, and by the nonselective MNK1/2 inhibitor cercosporamide. Here, we sought to better understand the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying how IL-6 causes nociceptor excitability via MNK-eIF4E signaling using the highly selective MNK inhibitor eFT508. DRG neurons were cultured from male and female ICR mice, 4-7 wk old. DRG cultures were treated with vehicle, IL-6, eFT508 (pretreat) followed by IL-6, or eFT508 alone. Whole cell patch-clamp recordings were done on small-diameter neurons (20-30 pF) to measure membrane excitability in response to ramp depolarization. IL-6 treatment (1 h) resulted in increased action potential firing compared with vehicle at all ramp intensities, an effect that was blocked by pretreatment with eFT508. Basic membrane properties, including resting membrane potential, input resistance, and rheobase, were similar across groups. Latency to the first action potential in the ramp protocol was lower in the IL-6 group and rescued by eFT508 pretreatment. We also found that the amplitudes of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) were increased in the DRG following IL-6 treatment, but not in the eFT508 cotreatment group. Our findings are consistent with a model wherein MNK-eIF4E signaling controls the translation of signaling factors that regulate T-type VGCCs in response to IL-6 treatment. Inhibition of MNK with eFT508 disrupts these events, thereby preventing nociceptor hyperexcitability.NEW & NOTEWORTHY In this study, we show that the MNK inhibitor and anti-tumor agent eFT508 (tomivosertib) is effective in attenuating IL-6 induced sensitization of dorsal root ganglion (DRG) nociceptors. Pretreatment with eFT508 in DRG cultures from mice helps mitigate the development of hyperexcitability in response to IL-6. Furthermore, our data reveal that the upregulation of T-type voltage-gated calcium channels following IL-6 application can be blocked by eFT508, implicating the MNK-eIF4E signaling pathway in membrane trafficking of ion channels."

This channel integrates several nociceptive signals. Particularly, it is modulated by intracellular pH (pHi). Na+/H+ exchanger 1 (NHE1) contributes to the maintenance of pHi in nociceptors. However, it is currently unknown whether the interaction between TRPA1 and NHE1 contributes to the nociceptive processing. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the functional interaction between NHE1 and TRPA1 in small dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from primary culture obtained from adult rats. Moreover, we also evaluated their possible interaction in acute and inflammatory pain. Zoniporide (selective NHE1 inhibitor) reduced pHi and increased intracellular calcium in a concentration-dependent fashion in DRG neurons. Zoniporide and allyl isothiocyanate (AITC, TRPA1 agonist) increased calcium transients in the same DRG neuron, whereas that A-967079 (TRPA1 antagonist) prevented the effect of zoniporide in DRG neurons. Repeated AITC induced TRPA1 desensitization and this effect was prevented by zoniporide. Both NHE1 and TRPA1 were localized at the membrane surface of DRG neurons in culture. Local peripheral zoniporide enhanced AITC-induced pronociception and this effect was prevented by A-967079. Likewise, zoniporide potentiated Complete Freund's Adjuvant (CFA)-induced hypersensitivity, effect which was prevented by A-967079 in vivo. CFA paw injection increased TRPA1 and decresed NHE1 protein expression in DRG. These results suggest a functional interaction between NHE1 and TRPA1 in DRG neurons in vitro. Moreover, data suggest that this interaction participates in acute and inflamatory pain conditions in vivo."

While intrathecal morphine preconditioning (ITMP) can reduce IRI in animals, the molecular processes underlying IRI and ITMP remain elusive. Transient receptor potential vanilloid type 1 (TRPV1) is highly expressed in cardiac sensory neurons and has a crucial role in detecting myocardial ischemia. This study aimed to determine the role of up-regulated dorsal root ganglion (DRG)-TRPV1 in IRI and whether its inhibition contributes to ITMP-induced cardioprotection. Animal model of IRI was established by left coronary artery occlusion (30 min) and reperfusion (2 h) in rats. Intrathecal intubation was prepared for morphine preconditioning, TRPV1-shRNA or selective TRPV1 antagonist administration. After IRI, both protein and phosphorylation levels of TRPV1 were significantly increased, and the immunofluorescence intensity of TRPV1 was increased and colocalized with μ-opioid receptors in DRG. Intrathecal pre-administration of either TRPV1-shRNA or TRPV1 antagonist significantly reduced myocardial injury and the upregulation of TRPV1 in DRG induced by IRI. Simultaneously, ITMP significantly suppressed TRPV1 protein expression and phosphorylation in DRG, as well as the heart infarct size and arrhythmia score caused by IRI. The suppression of TRPV1 elevation and activation by ITMP were reversed by intrathecal injection of the selective μ receptor antagonist. Furthermore, IRI elevated DRG cAMP, while intrathecal administration of the selective cAMP-PKA inhibitor reduced myocardial injury. Finally, we showed that activation of opioid receptor by morphine inhibited PKA activator-induced TRPV1 channel activity at the cellular level. These findings suggest that the elevation and activation of TRPV1 in DRG during myocardial ischemia-reperfusion might be responsible for cardiac injury. ITMP exerts cardioprotection by inhibiting DRG-TRPV1 activity via modulation cAMP. Therefore, inhibition of TRPV1 upregulation in DRG might be used as a novel therapeutic mechanism for myocardium ischemia-reperfusion injury."

First steps toward accounting for functioning information in the German DRG (G-DRG) system have been made; yet, there is no systematic integration of functioning information. The G-DRG system is part of the health system; it is embedded in and as such dependent on various stakeholders and vested interests. This study explores the stakeholder's perspective on integrating functioning information in the G-DRG system. A qualitative interview study was conducted with national stakeholders in 4 groups of the G-DRG system (health policy, administration, development, and consultations). Interviews were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis. In total, 14 interviews were conducted (4 administration and 10 consultation group). Three main themes were identified: (1) functioning information in the G-DRG system: opportunities and obstacles, (2) general aspects concerning optimizing G-DRG systems by integrating additional information, and (3) ideas and requirements on how to proceed. The study offers insights into the opportunities and obstacles of integrating functioning information in the G-DRG system. The relevance of functioning information was evident. However, the value of functioning information for the G-DRG system was seen critically. Integrating functioning information alone does not seem to be sufficient and a systems approach is needed."

Approximately half of the patients with MS experience severe pain; however, currently available therapeutics provide only insufficient relief. The mechanisms underlying the generation of neuropathic pain in patients with MS are not fully understood. Recently, we found that neutrophil elastase from accumulated neutrophils in the dorsal root ganglion (DRG) sensitizes DRG neurons and induces mechanical allodynia in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the mechanism underlying neutrophil accumulation in the DRG after myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG35-55, immunogenic peptide) immunization remains unclear. Here, we found that C-X-C motif ligand 1 (CXCL1) was upregulated in DRG neurons after MOG35-55 immunization. Increased expression of CXCL1 protein was also observed in primary cultured DRG neurons treated with MOG35-55, which was mediated through toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4). Gene silencing of TLR4 or CXCL1 in DRG neurons significantly attenuated neutrophil accumulation in the DRG and mechanical allodynia during the preclinical phase of EAE (around day 5 after immunization). Our results thus suggest that a TLR4-CXCL1 pathway in DRG neurons triggers neutrophil recruitment in the DRG and subsequent mechanical allodynia in response to MOG35-55."

Developing selective DRG stimulation to manage visceral pain requires knowledge of the topological distribution of colorectal afferent somata which are sparsely distributed in the DRG. Here, we implemented GCaMP6f to conduct high-throughput optical recordings of colorectal afferent activities in lumbosacral DRG, that is, optical electrophysiology. Using a mouse ex vivo preparation with distal colorectum and L5-S1 DRG in continuity, we recorded 791 colorectal afferents' responses to graded colorectal distension (15, 30, 40, and 60 mmHg) and/or luminal shear flow (20-30 mL/min), then functionally classified them into four mechanosensitive classes, and determined the topological distribution of their somata in the DRG. Of the 791 colorectal afferents, 90.8% were in the L6 DRG, 8.3% in the S1 DRG, and only 0.9% in the L5 DRG. L6 afferents had all four classes: 29% mucosal, 18.4% muscular-mucosal, 34% low-threshold (LT) muscular, and 18.2% high-threshold (HT) muscular afferents. S1 afferents only had three classes: 19.7% mucosal, 34.8% LT muscular, and 45.5% HT muscular afferents. All seven L5 afferents were HT muscular. In L6 DRG, somata of HT muscular afferents were clustered in the caudal region whereas somata of the other classes did not cluster in specific regions. Outcomes of this study can directly inform the design and improvement of next-generation neuromodulation devices that target the DRG to alleviate visceral pain in IBS patients."

Piezo1 is primarily expressed in nonsensory tissues, whereas Piezo2 is predominantly found in sensory tissues, including dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. However, a recent study demonstrated the intracellular calcium response to Yoda1, a selective Piezo1 agonist, in trigeminal ganglion (TG) neurons. Herein, we investigate the expression of Piezo1 mRNA and protein in mouse and human DRG neurons and the activation of Piezo1 via calcium influx by Yoda1. Yoda1 induces inward currents mainly in small- (< 25 μm) and medium-sized (25-35 μm) mouse DRG neurons. The Yoda1-induced Ca2+ response is inhibited by cationic channel blocker, ruthenium red and cationic mechanosensitive channel blocker, GsMTx4. To confirm the specific inhibition of Piezo1, we performed an adeno-associated virus serotype 2/5 (AAV2/5)-mediated delivery of short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into mouse DRG neurons. AAV2/5 transfection downregulates piezo1 mRNA expression and reduces Ca2+ response by Yoda1. Piezo1 also shows physiological functions with transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) in the same DRG neurons and is regulated by the activation of TRPV1 in mouse DRG sensory neurons. Overall, we found that Piezo1 has physiological functions in DRG neurons and that TRPV1 activation inhibits an inward current induced by Yoda1."

Even in DRGs for which a differentiation would be possible and economically appropriate it is often not permitted. A further rise of the systematic deficit of German University Hospitals (currently 300 Mio.

The underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and there are no effective therapies for LDH-induced pain. In the present study, we found that the patients who suffered from LDH-induced pain had elevated plasma methylglyoxal (MG) levels. In rats, implantation of autologous nucleus pulposus (NP) to the left lumbar 5 spinal nerve root, which mimicked LDH, induced mechanical allodynia, increased MG level in plasma and dorsal root ganglion (DRG), and enhanced the excitability of small DRG neurons (<30 μm in diameter). Intrathecal injection of MG also induced mechanical allodynia, and its application to DRG neurons ex vivo increased the number of action potentials evoked by depolarizing current pulses. Furthermore, inhibition of MG accumulation by aminoguanidine attenuated the enhanced excitability of small DRG neurons and the mechanical allodynia induced by NP implantation. In addition, NP implantation increased levels of advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in DRG, and intrathecal injection of MG-derived AGEs induced the mechanical allodynia and DRG neuronal hyperactivity. Intrathecal injection of MG also significantly increased the expression of AGEs in DRG. Importantly, scavenging of MG by aminoguanidine also attenuated the increase in AGEs induced by NP implantation. These results suggested that LDH-induced MG accumulation contributed to persistent pain by increasing AGE levels. Thus generation of AGEs from MG may represent a target for treatment of LDH-induced pain.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Our study demonstrates that methylglyoxal accumulation via increasing advanced glycation end-product levels in dorsal root ganglion contributes to the persistent pain induced by lumbar disk herniation, which proposed potential targets for the treatment of lumbar disk herniation-induced persistent pain."
